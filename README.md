# Password Complexity Checker

This is a simple Python tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback to users on the password's strength and suggestions to improve it.

## Usage

Run the `password_checker.py` script and input a password when prompted. The script will then evaluate the password and provide feedback.

```bash
python password_checker.py


Criteria for Password Strength
Length: At least 8 characters
Uppercase Letters: At least one uppercase letter
Lowercase Letters: At least one lowercase letter
Numbers: At least one numerical digit
Special Characters: At least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
